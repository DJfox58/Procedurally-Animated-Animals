This repository features a number of different simulated animals. The animals are drawn using procedural animation. <br/>

Credit to argonaut on YouTube for inspiring me to try this project with <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlfh_rv6khY&t=317s">this video.</a>

<p>The simulations are run in pygame. Feel free to check out and run the named files to view the simulations yourself!</p>
